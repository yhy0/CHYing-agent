If this was successful, return the chunk ant it's over, if not, continue executing the function...

#### if equal size

Continue removing the chunk from the bin, in case the requested size is exactly the one of the chunk:

- If the tcache is not filled, add it to the tcache and continue indicating that there is a tcache chunk that could be used
- If tcache is full, just use it returning it

#### place chunk in a bin

Store the checked chunk in the small bin or in the large bin according to the size of the chunk (keeping the large bin properly organized).

There are security checks being performed to make sure both large bin doubled linked list are corrupted:

- If `fwd->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize != fwd`: `malloc(): largebin double linked list corrupted (nextsize)`
- If `fwd->bk->fd != fwd`: `malloc(): largebin double linked list corrupted (bk)`

#### `_int_malloc` limits

At this point, if some chunk was stored in the tcache that can be used and the limit is reached, just **return a tcache chunk**.

Moreover, if **MAX_ITERS** is reached, break from the loop for and get a chunk in a different way (top chunk).

If `return_cached` was set, just return a chunk from the tcache to avoid larger searches.

### Large Bin (by index)

If the request is large (not in small bin) and we haven't yet returned any chunk, get the **index** of the requested size in the **large bin**, check if **not empty** of if the **biggest chunk in this bin is bigger** than the requested size and in that case find the **smallest chunk that can be used** for the requested size.

If the reminder space from the finally used chunk can be a new chunk, add it to the unsorted bin and the lsast_reminder is updated.

A security check is made when adding the reminder to the unsorted bin:

- `bck->fd-> bk != bck`: `malloc(): corrupted unsorted chunks`

### Top Chunk

At this point, it's time to get a new chunk from the Top chunk (if big enough).

It starts with a security check making sure that the size of the chunk size is not too big (corrupted):

- `chunksize(av->top) > av->system_mem`: `malloc(): corrupted top size`

Then, it'll use the top chunk space if it's large enough to create a chunk of the requested size.\
If not, if there are fast chunks, consolidate them and try again.\
Finally, if not enough space use `sysmalloc` to allocate enough size.

<details>

<summary><code>_int_malloc</code> Top chunk</summary>

```c
use_top:
      /*
         If large enough, split off the chunk bordering the end of memory
         (held in av->top). Note that this is in accord with the best-fit
         search rule.  In effect, av->top is treated as larger (and thus
         less well fitting) than any other available chunk since it can
         be extended to be as large as necessary (up to system
         limitations).

         We require that av->top always exists (i.e., has size >=
         MINSIZE) after initialization, so if it would otherwise be
         exhausted by current request, it is replenished. (The main
         reason for ensuring it exists is that we may need MINSIZE space
         to put in fenceposts in sysmalloc.)
